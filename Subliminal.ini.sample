# The Category (if detected from the NZB-File) to clasify the video as a
# tv (vs a movie).  This just allows you more control later on when specifying

# If subtitles of your specified language was already detected in the video
# do you want to ignore this and keep going anyway? Setting this to no
# causes a bit more overhead (because the video needs to be scanned
# to see if it has subtitles already in it), but it can be worth it as it will
# prevent going off and fetching more subs later on.
IgnoreEmbedded: no

# The providers you want to explicilty reference.  By default all of them are
# checked... but here you can filter the list if you choose:
Providers: opensubtitles, tvsubtitles, podnapisi, addic7ed, thesubdb

# My version of subliminal is significantly forked/altered from the original one
# so you can also help the filtering and accuracy of your response by telling
# the tool what to use when the nzb is detected to be either a movie or tv show
# by default these are not set (but it's really worth doing!) :)
MovieProviders: opensubtitles, podnapisi, thesubdb

# If we detect the video file is for TV Show's only, then we just search the
# following providers.  Comment this entry out if you just want to use the
# default values (defined by 'Providers' above).
TVShowProviders: tvsubtitles, addic7ed

# Setting this to yes before creating a ticket would 'really' help me debug
