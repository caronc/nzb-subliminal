        GuessIt is a python library that tries to extract as much information as
        possible from a video file.
        
        It has a very powerful filename matcher that allows to guess a lot of
        metadata from a video using only its filename. This matcher works with
        both movies and tv shows episodes.
        
        For example, GuessIt can do the following::
        
            $ python -m guessit "Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi"
            For: Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi
            GuessIt found: {
                [1.00] "mimetype": "video/x-msvideo",
                [0.80] "episodeNumber": 3,
                [0.80] "videoCodec": "XviD",
                [1.00] "container": "avi",
                [1.00] "format": "HDTV",
                [0.70] "series": "Treme",
                [0.50] "title": "Right Place, Wrong Time",
                [0.80] "releaseGroup": "NoTV",
                [0.80] "season": 1,
                [1.00] "type": "episode"
            }
        
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        At the moment, the filename matcher is able to recognize the following
        property types::
        
            [ title,                             # for movies and episodes
              series, season,                    # for episodes only
              episodeNumber, special,            # for episodes only
              date, year,                        # 'date' instance of datetime.date
              language, subtitleLanguage,        # instances of guessit.Language
              country,                           # instances of guessit.Country
              container, format,
              videoCodec, audioCodec,
              videoProfile, audioProfile,
              audioChannels, screenSize,
              releaseGroup, website,
              cdNumber, cdNumberTotal,
              filmNumber, filmSeries,
              bonusNumber, edition,
              idNumber,                          # tries to identify a hash or a serial number
              other
              ]
        
        
        GuessIt also allows you to compute a whole lof of hashes from a file,
        namely all the ones you can find in the hashlib python module (md5,
        sha1, ...), but also the Media Player Classic hash that is used (amongst
        others) by OpenSubtitles and SMPlayer, as well as the ed2k hash.
        
        If you have the 'guess-language' python module installed, GuessIt can also
        analyze a subtitle file's contents and detect which language it is written in.
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Installing GuessIt is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::
        
            $ pip install guessit
        
        or, with `easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::
        
            $ easy_install guessit
        
        But, you really `shouldn't do that <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/other-tools.html#pip-compared-to-easy-install>`_.

        * New options for the guessit cmdline util: ``-y``, ``--yaml`` outputs the
          result in yaml format and ``-n``, ``--name-only`` analyzes the input as simple
          text (instead of filename)
        * Added properties formatters and validators
        * Removed support for python 3.2
        * A healthy amount of code cleanup/refactoring and fixes :)
